## Description of Project :
>The Project is based on **Disease Detection of a Potato Plant** using a Machine Learning Model. There are 2 very prevalent diseases among Potato Plants, one **Late Blight** and the other one being **Early Blight**.  They are caused by different types of fungi that can affect the plants at different stages of their growth.

## Getting Started :

The project has `master` branch is explained here,

> `master` contains aggregate code of all deployments, training and backend.

Other details that need to be given while starting out with the project can be provided in this section. A project structure like below can also be included for the big projects :

	project-title
	├── README.md
	├── model.ipynb
	├── .gitignore
	├── api
	│   ├── main.py
	└── potatoes.h5
	└── requirement.txt


## Tools Required :

>All tools required go here. You would require the following tools to develop and run the project :
>
>*  Intel oneAPI Cloud Platform
>* Intel optimized Python
>* Intel oneAPI AI Analytics Toolkit
>* Fast API
>* Kotlin
>* Android Studio
>* AWS Cloud Server

## Model Training :
> The Machine Learning Model is trained using Convolutional Neural Network and is trained in the Intel oneAPI Cloud Platform.

## Deployment :

>The Model is deployed in Amazon Web Service Cloud Platform using Fast API which is connecting to a GUI Android Application which is given in the Drive link given above.

## Acknowledgments :
